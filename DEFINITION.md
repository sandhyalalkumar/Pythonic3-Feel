#### Dynamic Programming 

Dynamic programming is optimization over plain recursion.
It's simply stores the result of sub problems, so we do not have to recompute 
them when needed. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponetial
polynomial.

1. Tabulation - Bottom Up 
2. Memoization - Top Down

1. Tabulation -  It starts its transition from dp[0] and try to reach it state to dp[n]. Program creates one table which start from state dp[0] tp dp[n].

2. Memoization -
